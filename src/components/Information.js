                <li>
                  Designating single-stall restrooms as gender inclusive.

      <h3>Here are some methods that can help get this started!</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Single Stall Restrooms:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwhmPw3bTIBJU21JeTJxQk9zWkE/view?resourcekey=0-Ala4H4n8z_WUYU1Tw1E1Qw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2015 issuance of the UCOP Guidelines for Providing Gender Inclusive Facilities </a>
              directed the conversion of existing single-occupancy or single-stall restrooms in all UC-owned buildings 
              from gender-specific to gender inclusive facilities. 
              These conversions have typically been limited to revised signage. 
              Conversions that are accomplished by signage alone shall not be considered renovations.
            </li>
            <li>
              The 2021 update of the policy also notes that each existing 
              and newly constructed single-stall restroom shall be gender inclusive.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

          New Buildings/Major Renovations:

            <li>
              New construction or major renovation shall meet the following criteria

            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If the work occurs as part of a new building or major renovation, 
                gender inclusive facilities shall be provided.
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  When calculating required fixture count, up to one third 
                  (1/3) of the required plumbing fixtures may be included in GIRR.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In a new facility, provide at least one GIRR on each floor 
                  where restrooms are required. 
                  Each existing and 
                  newly constructed single-stall restroom shall be gender inclusive.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In a new facility, provide at 
                  least one multi-stall GIRR when more 
                  than one set of gender specific multi-stall restrooms 
                  are required for the building.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In a major renovation with more than one set of gender 
                  specific multi-stall restrooms, 
                  provide at least one multi-stall GIRR.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each gender specific restroom shall have at least one 
                  adjacent single-stall restroom, unless a set of GIRR are adjacent.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each multi-stall GIRR shall have at least one adjacent single-stall restroom, 
                  unless a set of gender specific restrooms are adjacent.

          </ul>

        <li>
          Conversion of Existing Restrooms:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Departments may request to change an existing gender specific facility to GIRR, 
              or request that a GIRR be provided within a specific University building.
            </li>
            <li>
              Conversions of existing restrooms not as part of a 
              major renovation shall comply with the UCOP policy. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Process for conversions:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If you are interested in having a restroom converted, 
                  discuss the conversion with a department representative of that building 
                  (such as an advisor, supervisor, or other staff member). 
                </li>
                <li>
                  After the request is made:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Upon receipt of the request, 
                      the department representative will discuss the 
                      request with the building Facility Manager (where applicable) 
                      or the campus LGBTQ Director (if the building does not have a Facility Manager)
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          In buildings without a Building Manager, key stakeholders, including department chairs, directors,
                          and other administrators should be consulted for their approval to convert the facility.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Information to gather before submitting a request for conversion: 
                      1) target restroom(s) for conversion, and 2) breakdown of 
                      all restrooms in the building, by floor and gender designation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Once the FM or the LGBTQ Director has determined the request should be considered, 
                      they will submit the request to the CBD to determine if the request can be approved under current code and guidelines
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If the CBO determines the request is feasible per section B.2, 
                      the CBO shall approve the request and inform the requesting party that the project may proceed to scoping and design.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Scoping and design will be done by the requesting department working with Capital Projects as necessary.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      During the scoping process, cost implications for the conversion are identified, and the source(s) of funding are determined.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When the funding has been identified and the Building Manager gives their approval, 
                      the conversion should move forward through a typical process, including proper notice to key stakeholders in the building.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
